            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in the south Indian town of Tamil Nad, named Erode. <br>Since a very early age, he had a keen interest in mathematics and had already become a child prodigy</p>
        <li>Early Age and Education</li>
            <p>His love for mathematics had grown at a very young age and was mostly self-taught <br>He continued to excel in only one subject and kept failing in all others. This resulted in him dropping out of college <br>However, he continued to work on his collection of mathematical theorems, ideologies and concepts until he got his final breakthrough</p>
        <li>In the year 1912</li>
            <p>he was appointed at the position of clerk in the Madras Post Trust Office, where the manager, S.N. Aiyar encouraged him to reach out to G.H. Hardy, a famous mathematician at the Cambridge University</p>
        <li>In the year 1913</li>
            <p>He had sent the famous letter to Hardy, in which he had attached 120 theorems as a sample of his work <br>Hardy along with another mathematician at Cambridge, J.E.Littlewood analysed his work and concluded it to be a work of true genius
            </p>
        <li>In the year 1920</li>
            <p>Ramanujan's health had started to deteriorate, after which he decided to move back to India <br> After his return, his health further worsened and he died at the age of just 32 years</p>
